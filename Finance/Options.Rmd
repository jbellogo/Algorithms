## Binomial Lattice

Consider the $N-$period binomial model with $0<d<e^{r\Delta t} < u$. Suppose the derivative payout at maturity $V_N$ is a random variable with known distribution. 

Idea: Starting from the leaves (known $V_N$), we will recursively go down levels $n= N-1, \dots, 0$ computing discounted expected values:
\[ V_n(\omega_1, \dots, \omega_n) = e^{-r\Delta T}\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}(V_{n+1}|\mathcal{F}_n) \]
