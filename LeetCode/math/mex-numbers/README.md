# MEX 

MEX is the smallest natural number that is not in the array.

updateMEX : list[int], int -> int
- takes arr and len(arr) and removes the minimum number of elements from it so that the MEX value of the modified arrray is different from the original MEX value.

code just returns minimum number of elements to remove. -1 if not possible.
