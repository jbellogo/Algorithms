# Algorithmic Patterns
Understanding algorithmic patterns is crucial here are some of the key problem-solving techniques:

- Two Pointer Problems
- Backtracking Pattern – Solve constraint-based problems using recursion to explore possibilities. 
- Dynamic Programming Patterns. 
- Binary Search Template 
- General Backtracking Approach – Gain a systematic approach to solving combinatorial problems. 
- Binary Tree Traversal & Views – Understand DFS, BFS, and different tree views for problem-solving. 
- Graph Algorithms: Traversals, Shortest paths, in spanning trees. 
- Bit Manipulation Techniques – Learn different patterns and optimizations using bitwise operations. 
- String Problem Patterns – Master key techniques for solving string-related challenges. 
- Leetcode BFS + DFS Guide – Solve 25% of problems using fundamental graph traversals.
