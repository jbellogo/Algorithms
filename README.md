# Algorithmic Patterns
Understanding algorithmic patterns is crucial here are some of the key problem-solving techniques:

- Two Pointer Problems – Optimize searching and sorting problems using two pointers to traverse arrays efficiently. 
- Backtracking Pattern – Solve constraint-based problems using recursion to explore possibilities. 
- Dynamic Programming Patterns – Break problems into subproblems, using memoization and tabulation for optimization. 
- Binary Search Template – Master binary search techniques for searching sorted arrays efficiently. 
- General Backtracking Approach – Gain a systematic approach to solving combinatorial problems. 
- Binary Tree Traversal & Views – Understand DFS, BFS, and different tree views for problem-solving. 
- Graph Algorithms for Beginners – Explore fundamental graph traversal techniques and patterns. 
- Monotonic Stack Problems – Solve stack-based problems with structured approaches.
