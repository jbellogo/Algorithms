# Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


# Important 
This is dynamic programming, it can be done recursively with a memoization optimization, but recall that iterative solutions are often more efficient than their recursive solutions if not always easier to formulate.
